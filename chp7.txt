Maximum length for a username	32
T/F user names must begin with a letter	True
Why is using special punctuation in a username a bad idea?	Several key utilities impose more restrictive rules on naming - e.g. useradd
What is a common practical upper limit for username length? Why?	8, some administrative utilities truncate past 8 characters.
T/F linux account names are case sensitive	True
Linux users are organized into ____	groups
T/F It is possible to control access to hardware by modifying file permissions	True
Which file controls user membership to groups	/etc/group
Which file defines users' primary group	/etc/passwd
Which file defines user accounts?	/etc/passwd
newgrp &lt;groupname&gt;	Change your current group for running programs and creating files as
UID	Useer Identifier
GID	Group Identifier
Linux distributions reserve at least the first ___ sequential user and group Ids for system use	100
What is significant about UID/GID 0	It is the root account and group Id
Linux user and group ids typically start at either ____ or ____	500 or 1000
T/F Most account administration tools recycle ids belonging to previously deleted users and groups	False
Why is reusing a UID or GID potentially problematic?	If old files exist that belong to the old Id, the new account/group re-using that Id will own those files.
Which file can control limits on valid UID ranges?	/etc/login.defs
What is typically the GID on most distributions that have a shared "users" group	100
T/F It is possible for user's to share the same UID	True, they are treated equivalently for permissions, but may have seperate home directories, passwords, etc. (Should be avoided)
T/F Any account with UID 0 is given full control on the system	True, equivalent to root

useradd -p	Specify a pre-encrypted password
useradd -s	Set the user's default shell
useradd -u	specify a UID
Which flags allow useradd to create shared UIDs?	-u UID -o (-u to specify the UID and -o is to enable sharing)

How are users prevented from logging in when their account is locked?	User's encrypted password is prefixed with !

usermod -L	lock a user's password (same as passwd -l)
usermod -U	unlock a user's password (same as passwd -u)
usermod -G	add user to groups to those listed, this is not additive to the user's existing groups without -a
chage	modify account settings relating to account expiration
Which two ways can an account automatically expire?	Password hasn't been changed recently enough, system date is past an account expiration date

What does a user's password marked with an 'x' mean in /etc/passwd	The encrypted password is found in /etc/shadow
How can a user account be active but not able to log in?	Set the user's shell to something that prevents gaining access to a full shell. e.g. /bin/false, /bin/passwd
What happens if you set a user's default shell to /bin/shutdown	Whenever that account logs in, the system will shutdown
Which fields (and their order) are listed in /etc/shadow	username<div>password</div><div>last password change</div><div>days until password may be changed</div><div>days before change is required</div><div>days of warning before password expiration</div><div>days between expiration and dactivation</div><div>expiration date</div><div>special flag (future use, usually meaningless)</div>
Why is it a bad idea to copy passwords between systems found in /etc/shadow	Encrypted passwords are salted, by copying the password instead of re-running passwd it is obvious the passwords are identical between the systems
A user is able to log into a system, but their account does not appear in /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow. What is going on?	The system uses a centralized network account database (e.g. NIS, LDAP, AD, Kerberos, etc)
