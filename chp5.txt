GRUB	Grand Unified Boot Loader
What are the numbering schemes for GRUB Legacy vs GRUB 2	GRUB Legacy extends to 0.97; GRUB 2 uses 1.9x and 2.x
MBR&nbsp;	Master Boot Record
Two boot strategies used by BIOS	1. Find the bootable partition, load the boot sector, run secondary boot loader, run OS<div>2. Directly execute an OS kernel (bypass the secondary boot loader)</div>
EFI	Extensible Firmware Interface
EFI Boot Loader Strategy	Store a seperate boot loader for each OS installed.
T/F BIOS uses a boot manager program to manage each installed boot loader on a system	False (but this is true for EFI)
GRUB Location in MBR	In unallocated sectors directly after the MBR
GRUB Location in GPT	A special BIOS Boot Partition
What are superblocks?	Describes filesystem features like size and status. Can also hold a boot loader in systems using BIOS.
T/F Boot loaders must always exist in a superblock	False, this is only true for BIOS systems
Name some commands capable of providing superblock information	debugfs, dumpe2fs
T/F GRUB Legacy partition numbering starts from 0	True
GRUB Config Title	Label to display in the boot loader menu
GRUB Config: Root option	Specifies the location of GRUB Legacy's root partition. Traditionally /boot (or / if /boot does not exist)
T/F GRUB can exist on FAT formatted partitions	True, can also exist on many other filesystems and media types
GRUB Config: Kernel Specification	Defines location (relative to GRUB root) and options to pass to the kernel.
What convention does the GRUB format for selecting a hard disk and partition follow?	(disk,partition) e.g. (hd0,5)
Describe this GRUB configuration line: (hd0,5)/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/sda5	Boot the Kernel named vmlinuz found on sda partition 5 read only and mount /dev/sda5 as the root filesystem.
What is a RAM Disk?	Minimal set of drivers, utilities, and configuration files needed by the Linux kernel to boot and read from disk.
GRUB option for specifying an initial RAM disk.	initrd
What is rootnoverify used for in GRUB?	GRUB will not attempt to access files in the partition, used to load an OS when GRUB cannot directly load the kernel (DOS/Windows)
What is GRUB chainloading?	Tell GRUB to pass control to another boot loader, commonly used with +1 to load the first sector of the target OS's root partition.
GRUB Legacy supports both BIOS and EFI	False
GRUB 2 supports both BIOS and EFI	True
Which command can be used to look at kernel ring buffer logs?	dmesg
Runlevels range from __ to __	0 to 6
Runlevel 0	Shutdown
Runlevel 1	Single user mode
Runlevel 2	Debian - Full multi-user mode with graphical support. Undefined in most other distros
Runlevel 3	Full multi-user mode without graphical support (Most distributions)
Runlevel 4	Undefined and customizable
Runlevel 5	multi-user with graphical support (Most distributions)
Runlevel 6	Reboot
Which file contains run level config and definitions?	/etc/inittab
inittab configuration format	id:runlevels:action:process
inittab action: wait	Wait for the process to terminate
inittab action: respawn	Respawn the process whenever it terminates
T/F inittab runlevels are comma delimited	False, they are not delimited at all (e.g. to enable running on levels 3, 4, and 5 = 345)
SysV start scripts should start with the letter ____	S
SysV stop scripts should begin with ____	K
chkconfig --list	List services and their applicable runlevels
Using chkconfig how would I turn on a severvice named updog for run levels 2 and 3?	chkconfig --level 23 updog on &nbsp;(can also use off and reset)
Specify the default runlevel on SysV	id:&lt;runlevel&gt;:initdefault: (e.g. id:5:initdefault:)
These commands can be used to change your runlevel	init, telinit
telinit q	Implement changes made to /etc/inittab
initctl reload	Make upstart reload its configuration
Upstart service scripts are located at	/etc/init/&lt;servicename&gt;.conf
systemctl list-units	Display current status of all configured units
systemctl start <i>name</i>	start a named unit
systemctl stop <i>name</i>	Stop the named unit
systemctl reload <i>name</i>	Force a unit to reload its configuration
systemctl restart <i>name</i>	Cause the named unit to shutdown and restart
systemctl status <i>name</i>	Display status of the named unit (can use a PID instead)
systemctl enable <i>name</i>	Enable the named unit to start on boot
systemctl disable <i>name</i>	Do not start the named unit at boot
What is systemctl?	Control program for systemd init system
Name the three most common init systems	SysV, Upstart, Systemd
