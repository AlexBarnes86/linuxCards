LBA - What does it stand for? What is it?   Logical (Linear) Block Addressing; Unique number assigned per sector on the disk. Leaves translation to disk location to the firmware.
T/F Coldplug vs Hotplug refers to whether or not a socket is safe to touch. False
T/F Hotplug devices are called hot because removing them while in operation is damaging to the system   False; Hotplug devices can be added or removed at any time, coldplug should only be done when the system is off (cold)
What is the sysfs filesystem?   Virtual, mounted at /sys - contains info about devices for userspace
T/F When root runs a process that process is running in privileged kernel space False
HAL (hald)  Hardware Abstraction Layer Daemon - Provides info on hardware to user space programs
D-Bus   Enables processes to communicate about &nbsp;(and be notified of) hardware events.
udev - What is it? Where on the filesystem can we configure it? virtual filesystem located at /dev; Configuration found in /etc/udev
Which of these are hotpluggable? USB, RS-232, Parallel, Ethernet    USB, Ethernet
In addition to software, older devices can have IRQ and IO Addresses assigned via hardware pins commonly known as ____  jumpers
T/F Most PCI devices are automatically configured correctly True
This command allows users to query and adjust low level PCI configuration information.  setpci
This command lists information on currently installed pci devices   lspci
lspci -v, -vv, -vvv, -vvvv are used for?    Increasing verbosity of lspci output
What does lspci -n do? How does it compare to -nn   Displays raw manufacturer numeric codes instead of user friendly names; -nn includes both manufacturer names and codes
lspci -b is for?    Show data as seen by other devices on the system (IRQ and such)
lspci -t is for?    Display a tree view of pci devices on the system
lspci -s does?  Filters pci devices by a given specification [[[[domain]:]bus]:][slot][.[func]]
lspci -d    Show pci info for a given device [vendor]:[device]
lspci -i is used for?   specify a given file to use for mapping vendor ids to device names
lspci -m does? how does it compare to -mm?  dump pci data in machine readable form for scripts; -mm is a newer standard.
lspci -D    display PCI Domain
lspci -M    Full bus scan to identify hidden/misconfigured devices. (requires root)
T/F lspci -v and -version are the same  False -v is to control verbosity level, -version is to display version information and exit.
Kernel drivers in linux come in the form of kernel ____ modules
Kernel modules are stored where on the filesystem?  /lib/modules
Use this command to display currently loaded kernel modules lsmod
This command displays addition information about a kernel module    modinfo
Which two programs can be used to load kernel modules?  insmod, modprobe
How does insmod differ from modprobe?   insmode can only install a single module and fails if missing dependencies. modprobe is recursive
T/F modprobe requires a full path to the kernel module for installation False; modprobe uses configuration files to retrieve this information
modprobe -v -v, --verbose
modprobe -C filename    Change configuration files
modprobe -n -n, --dry-run
modprobe -r -r, --remove: unload an installed module
modprobe -f -f, --force
Show kernel module dependencies with    modprobe --show-depends
modprobe -l list all available modules
T/F: The unmod command unloads a kenel module   False - use rmmod
rmmod -w    -w, --wait: wait until the module is no longer being used before removing it
T/F: rmmod can only remove a single module and will fail if there are any dependent modules True
T/F modprobe can be used to remove modules  True
T/F: USB 2.0 changed to a new connection standard for maximum performance   False
T/F: USB 3.0 changed to a new connection standard for maximum performance   True; though it is physically compatible with the old standard just with degraded performance.
T/F: A Linux system can operate over 100 USB devices concurrently connected to a system.    True
Which of these are Linux USB controllers: UHCI, SHCI, OHCI, EHCI    All except SHCI
This tool is used to list usb devices on a system   lsusb
lsusb -v    verbose
lsusb -s    Restrict output to the given specification [[bus]:][devnum]
lsusb -d    limit output to the given [vendor]:[product]
lsusb -D filename   Display info on a usb device listed in /proc/bus/usb
lsusb -t    tree view
lsusb -V    --version
USB device information is made available where in /proc?    /proc/bus/usb
These two programs are used in managing usb devices.    usbmgr, hotplug
T/F: hotplug is newer and preferred over usbmgr True
T/F: Since USB is hotpluggable I can safely remove an active usb storage device.    False, it should be unmounted first.
